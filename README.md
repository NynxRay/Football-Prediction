# Football-Prediction

we use various supervised machine learning classifiers to predict the result of football game. Using match data from the English, Spanish and German first division football games between 2000 and 2016, features are extracted which can then be evaluated by 6 classifiers including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Neural Networks to predict whether the Home Team won or not.
